        \ over to the Tunisian government when the mining companies were nationalized.\
        \ The museum features a series of panels and display cases focusing on the\
        \ history of iron. There is also a selection of iron ore samples and mining\
        \ artefacts, the oldest dating back to the 1800s.\n\nA stroll around the mine\
        \ floor allows you to get up close and personal with some very old objects:\
        \ the carcass of an ambulance dating from the Second World War, a locomotive\
        \ dating from 1952 and still running, a siderite roasting furnace (shut down\
        \ in 1960), the mine manager's office house, a real gem built during the French\
        \ colony, a bene of an old teleferic used to transport iron carbonate to the\
        \ roasting furnace. \n\n"}
