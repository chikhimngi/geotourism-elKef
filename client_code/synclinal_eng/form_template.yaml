        Why visit the site?**\n\nThe circuit shown in figures 1 and 2, approximately\
        \ 3.5 km long, takes us to the heart of the Eocene perched syncline of Dyr\
        \ El Kef (fig.2, photo 1). This is a boat-bottom-shaped geological structure\
        \ whose edges dip 10\xb0 to 20\xb0 towards the heart of the structure. The\
        \ section to the north of the town of Le Kef covers some 6 km2 and culminates\
        \ locally at 900m. The fold affects an imposing 60m-thick bar of nummulite\
        \ limestone. The syncline is perched, since the rocks that make it up are\
        \ higher than those that frame it on either side (fig. 2 and photo).\n\nIn\
        \ addition to its obvious geological interest, the site's landscape is marked\
        \ by the concave shape of the nummulite limestone slab, the presence of caves\
        \ and karstic cavities, and faults from which emerge the Sidi Mansour spring,\
        \ which has supplied the region with drinking water for thousands of years\
        \ (fig.2). It's also a region of greenery and game. Historically, the region\
        \ has been described as a refuge for prehistoric man, as attested by the rock\
        \ paintings still visible in the locality known as esh-Sheguega (Tlili Mohamed,\
        \ historian). \n\nThe site is also of educational interest. High school students\
        \ survey the site using geological cross-sections and maps to understand the\
        \ formation and evolution of such a structure. They observe and draw sedimentary\
        \ rocks and their fossils, represented here by a lumachelle of nummulites\
        \ (photo). They learn how to read a geological map, and what an outcrop, rock\
        \ or mineral is.\n\n\n**2.\tSummary of important information to remember:**\n\
        \nThe structure of the Dyr El Kef perched syncline is the result of a series\
        \ of deformations undergone by the region from -250 Ma to the present day.\n\
        \n-  The layers that form the syncline were deposited horizontally (Fig. 3a)\
        \ under water or on land between the Triassic (-245 Ma) and Upper Miocene\
        \ (-5.3 Ma). This process is synchronous with the eastward displacement of\
        \ the African plate relative to the European plate. This is continental drift.\
        \ Plates move apart or slide relative to one another. This is called distensive\
        \ tectonics. Distensive tectonics gave rise to the oceans.\n-  In the Late\
        \ Cretaceous (70 Ma), the African plate began to move northwards t  owards\
        \ the European plate. The two plates collide, giving rise to mountain ranges\
        \ (fig.3b, c). In northern Tunisia, the formation of mountain ranges dates\
        \ from the Upper Miocene (-5.3 Ma) to the Pliocene (-1.8 Ma). Subsequent to\
        \ their formation, the mountain ranges have undergone profound modifications\
        \ (dismantling, erosion), which have resulted in the geology of today (fig.4).\
