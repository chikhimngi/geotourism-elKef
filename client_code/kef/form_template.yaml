        \ 1000m at Dyr El Kef and 1100m at Jebel Slata. The climate is semi-arid.\
        \ Temperatures vary between 6 and 7\xb0C in winter and 25 to 27\xb0C in summer.\
        \ Annual rainfall is between 380 and 400 mm/year.\n\nThe governorate of Kef\
        \ is an agricultural region covering 485,153 hectares, including 102,215 hectares\
        \ of forests and 337,489 hectares of farmland. \n\nHistorically, the town\
