        \ the Eocene \n2.\tSite: Kef R'Gueb\n3.\t Location: 36.12067, 8.90201\n\n\
        **II.\tAdvice and practical information**\n\n- Land situation : State-owned\n\
        - Access: easy via tarmac road in good condition\n- Departure point : the\
        \ town of Le Kef (fig.2). \n\n- Distance: 20km.\n- Lack of signposting\n-\
        \ Undeveloped access paths to the site.\n\n\n**III.\tSite description**\n\n\
        **1 Interest in visiting the site** \n\n**Geological interest**:\n\nThe site\
        \ corresponds to a faulted fold dipping to the NW and affecting alternating\
        \ limestones and marls at the base of the Eocene. This fold is sealed by the\
        \ Eocene nummulite limestone slab. This structure indicates that the area\
        \ was the site of tectonic instability during the sedimentation of the Eocene\
        \ nummulite limestone bar 65 Ma ago.\n\n**Landscape interest**\n\nThe Eocene\
        \ series is criss-crossed by a small river where, over the years, water has\
        \ carved grooves in which small waterfalls have been created. The calm of\
        \ the place and the sound of falling water make it an ideal place for rest\
        \ and relaxation.\n\n**Historical interest**\n\nClose to the Eocene fold is\
        \ a Roman mill used to press olives (Tlili Mohamed, historian).\n\n**2.\t\
        Summary of important information to remember**\n\nThe interest of this site\
        \ is to show that the region was marked by a tectonic instability in compression\
        \ manifested by the formation of an anticlinal fold affecting the marl-limestone\
        \ alternations of the base of the Eocene. The fold is sealed by the Eocene\
        \ nummulite limestone slab. \n\nAs is the case throughout northern Tunisia,\
        \ the Eocene limestone at this site is a good reservoir for drinking water.\
        \ In fact, when the Romans first arrived, they settled in these water-rich\
        \ areas, which were more favorable to the development of housing and agriculture,\
        \ and where various remains have been found, including the oil mill.\n\n**IV.\t\
