    properties: {content: "The Jerissa mine has been mining iron ore in Tunisia since\
        \ 1901.\nTwo products are extracted and marketed:\n- Siderite (feCo3), once\
        \ used as an additive\nas a cattle feed additive, has now been abandoned due\
        \ to the depletion of\ndepletion of reserves. \n- Hematite\n(Fe2O3), used\
        \ as an additive in the cement industry, is still being quarried.\nThe mine\
        \ itself is an open-air museum, with the company headquarters built in 1907\
        \ (photo), its old electrical and compressed-air installations electrical\
        \ and compressed-air installations that bear witness to an important activity\
        \ that lasted more than 100 years. The mine overlooks a superb village, built\
        \ during the colonial era and still retaining the charm of its tiled roofs.\
        \ This pretty village has been dubbed \"Little Paris\".\n\nis mined in a series\
        \ of quarries and underground galleries. Each structure we visit provides\
        \ an insight into the different stages of iron mining. It's also an opportunity\
        \ to get hands-on with the iron ore, to understand its genesis and the geological\
        \ and structural context of the region, which spans several hundred million\
        \ years.\nThe mine has its own museum. It is housed in the Saint Barbe church,\
        \ built during the French protectorate and handed over to the Tunisian government\
        \ when the mining companies were nationalized. The museum features a series\
        \ of panels and display cases focusing on the history of iron. There is also\
        \ a selection of iron ore samples and mining artefacts, the oldest dating\
        \ back to the 1800s.\n\nA stroll around the mine floor gives you the chance\
        \ to get up close to some very old objects: the carcass of an ambulance dating\
        \ back to the Second World War, a locomotive dating back to 1952 and still\
        \ running today (2020), a siderite roasting furnace, the Director's office\
        \ house, a real gem built during the French colony, a bene of an old teleferic\
        \ used to transport iron carbonate to the roasting furnace.\n\n\n"}
